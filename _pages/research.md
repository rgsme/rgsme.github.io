The research group is a multidisciplinary team of engineers and scientists that specialize in the design and development of **smart mechatronic systems**. They conduct research in various areas, including **digital transformation**, **life cycle assessment**, **energy usage in manufacturing**, and **modelling and simulation**. Their expertise enables them to create advanced mechatronic systems that are **efficient, effective, and sustainable**.

## Engineering Processes

The research group's engineering processes are at the forefront of the industry. They use cutting-edge technologies such as **computer-aided design (CAD)**, **computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)**, and **computer-aided engineering (CAE)** to simulate and optimize the performance of their systems. CAD software allows them to create 3D models of their systems, while CAM software enables them to produce parts with high precision and accuracy. CAE software is used to analyze the performance of the systems and optimize their design.

In addition to these tools, the research group also employs other engineering processes such as **failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)**, **design for manufacturability (DFM)**, and **design for reliability (DFR)**. These processes enable them to create systems that are **reliable, safe, and cost-effective**.

## Sustainability in Mechatronic System Development

Sustainability is a key consideration in the development of mechatronic systems. The research group conducts **life cycle assessments** to evaluate the environmental impact of their products. Life cycle assessment is a methodology that considers the entire life cycle of a product, from raw material sourcing to disposal. By using this methodology, the research group can identify areas where they can improve their processes and reduce their environmental impact.

The research group also employs **sustainable practices** in the development of their systems. For example, they use **energy-efficient manufacturing processes** and **materials that are environmentally friendly**. They also prioritize the use of **recyclable materials** to reduce waste and promote a **circular economy**.

## Digital Transformation

The research group is committed to adopting **digital transformation** technologies to improve their processes and overall efficiency. They use **digital twins** to simulate and optimize the performance of their mechatronic systems. Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical systems that enable the group to test and refine their designs without the need for physical prototypes. This approach reduces costs and time to market while improving overall product quality.

## Modelling and Simulation of Mechatronic Systems

Modelling and simulation are core competencies of the research group. They use various techniques, such as **finite element analysis (FEA)**, **electronics simulations**, and **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)**, to predict the behavior of mechatronic systems under various operating conditions. These techniques enable them to optimize the performance of their systems, reduce development costs, and accelerate time to market.

The research group also uses **virtual reality (VR)** and **augmented reality (AR)** to create interactive simulations and visualize complex mechatronic systems. VR enables them to create immersive simulations that allow users to interact with the system in a realistic and engaging way. AR is used to overlay digital information onto the physical world, enabling users to visualize and interact with the system in real-time.
