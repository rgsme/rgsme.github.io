The [Smart Mechatronics Engineering research group]({{ '/members' | relative_url }}) is dedicated to advancing the **field of mechatronics and manufacturing systems** through cutting-edge research and development. Our focus is on the **digital twin** of mechatronic and manufacturing systems, which involves creating virtual representations of physical systems for the purpose of simulation, analysis, and control.

In addition to digital twin technology, we also study **energy usage in the manufacturing industry** and its impact on the environment. Through our research, we aim to identify and implement ways to reduce energy consumption in manufacturing processes while maintaining efficiency and productivity.

Another area of focus for our group is **life cycle assessment** and **circular economy**. We examine the environmental impact of products and manufacturing processes throughout their entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to disposal or recycling. Our goal is to promote sustainable manufacturing practices and circular economy models that minimize waste and conserve resources.

Our research group is composed of experts in various fields, including **mechatronics, manufacturing, and sustainable engineering**. We [collaborate with leading industry partners and academic institutions]({{ '/partners' | relative_url }}) to conduct research and develop new technologies that can be applied in real-world scenarios.

The Smart Mechatronics Engineering research group is committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the field of mechatronics and manufacturing, and we are constantly seeking new ways to improve efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and promote sustainability.
