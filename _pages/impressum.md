No data is collected which can identify users.

The information collected through Panelbear is used to improve the functionality and usability of our website. We may use this information to track user behavior, identify areas of improvement, and analyze website traffic. The information collected is also used for statistical analysis to understand how visitors use our website.

#### Disclosure of Information

We do not share or disclose any information collected through Panelbear to any third parties. The information is used solely by us to improve our website and to understand the behavior of our visitors.

#### Data Storage

All information collected through Panelbear is anonymized and stored in EU data centers. The hosting service at FH OÖ may also collect additional data such as IP addresses, browser type and version, pages visited and time spent on the website. FH OÖ has implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the data.
