We offer a range of courses for undergraduate and graduate students in various disciplines. We strive to provide a comprehensive education that equips our students with the knowledge, skills, and hands-on experience necessary to excel in their careers.

## Control Systems Engineering

Our courses in control systems engineering cover the fundamental principles of feedback control systems and their application in a wide range of industries, including aerospace, automotive, and manufacturing. Students learn how to design, model, and analyze control systems, and how to use simulation tools to evaluate system performance. Practical projects provide students with opportunities to apply these concepts to real-world problems.

## Mechanical Engineering

Our courses in mechanical engineering cover the fundamental principles of mechanics, thermodynamics, and materials science, and their application in the design and analysis of mechanical systems. Students learn how to design and analyze mechanical components and systems, and how to use computer aided design (CAD) tools to create and evaluate designs. Practical projects provide students with opportunities to apply these concepts to real-world problems.

## Electrical Engineering

Our courses in electrical engineering cover the fundamental principles of circuits, signals, and systems, and their application in a wide range of industries, including telecommunications, power, and electronics. Students learn how to design, model, and analyze electrical systems, and how to use simulation tools to evaluate system performance. Practical projects provide students with opportunities to apply these concepts to real-world problems.

## Mechatronics

Our courses in mechatronics cover the integration of mechanical, electrical, and computer systems to create complex products and systems. Students learn how to design, model, and analyze mechatronic systems, and how to use simulation tools to evaluate system performance. Practical projects provide students with opportunities to apply these concepts to real-world problems, and to develop skills in interdisciplinary teamwork and communication.

## Computer Aided Design (CAD) and CAx

Our courses in CAD and CAx cover the use of computer tools to design, model, and analyze products and systems. Students learn how to use software tools to create 3D models, simulate system performance, and evaluate designs. Practical projects provide students with opportunities to apply these concepts to real-world problems, and to develop skills in computer-aided engineering (CAE), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and computer-aided analysis (CAA).

## Sustainable Development

Our courses in sustainable development cover the integration of environmental, social, and economic considerations into product and system design and development. Students learn how to evaluate the environmental impact of products and systems, and how to develop strategies for sustainable design, production, and end-of-life management. Practical projects provide students with opportunities to apply these concepts to real-world problems, and to develop skills in sustainable innovation and entrepreneurship.

## Thesis Topics

In addition to our regular course offerings, we offer opportunities for students to undertake bachelor and master thesis projects under the supervision of our faculty. These projects provide students with valuable experience in conducting research, analyzing data, and communicating their findings, and often lead to opportunities for publication and further research in their chosen fields.

We actively encourage students to propose or ask for detailed topics related to their research interests, or to seek guidance from our faculty in developing a suitable research topic. We believe that this approach fosters a sense of ownership and engagement in the research process, and allows students to pursue topics that are of particular interest to them.

We are always seeking motivated students who are passionate about exploring new ideas and advancing their understanding of their chosen field. If you are interested in pursuing a thesis project, we encourage you to reach out to our faculty and explore the many exciting opportunities available to you.
