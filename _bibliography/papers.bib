  abstract = {The paper presents a product lifecycle management meta-model for the design of systems of systems and discusses how the information technology \textendash{} architecture, influences product lifecycle management interoperability. The current trends in systems of systems engineering starts with the consideration of networked mechatronic systems, often also called cyber-physical systems, which can also be seen as sub-parts of systems of systems. Hence, data models are needed to describe the product lifecycle of systems of systems on the basis of existing meta-models for single (mechatronic) systems. The main key findings are the clear understanding of the elements of the design and of their relations, which are describing the primary structure of systems of systems and the sub-elements. These meta-models are the basis for analysing the information enrichment and change management during the design process.},

  abstract = {Hierarchical modeling helps to describe product models and data from different viewpoints that, representing the different disciplines involved in the design process of mechatronic systems. This paper gives an overview of hierarchical modeling techniques. This includes the investigation of systems, which requires handling different issues that address very specific views of the system (system aspects) and come from various disciplines. Also the model granularity which describes the extent to which an object or model is broken down into smaller elements it an important aspect. The different phases of the product life cycle require models with different objectives and levels of detail. Some models are needed mainly in specific phases of the product life cycle, which are discussed in detail in the paper. Especially in the conceptual design phase some design-characteristic aspects such as hierarchy of parameters, modularity of the design should be analyzed, because in this phase the largest part of the later resulting product costs is predetermined or even fixed. As a consequence, the scope for design is limited to merely small changes in the subsequent design phases. Therefore the interaction between the design phases and the related models plays an important role the development process of mechatronic systems.},

The objective of the hierarchical modeling and simulation is to achieve the integration of all data and simulation results in a common interface. Different simulation tools have to be integrated in a common user environment, which is normally a very difficult and exhaustive work. A Meta-model framework is developed, using a combination of traditional simulation and cosimulation approaches and helps to define the linkage of different system levels. Finally an implementation of a demonstrator (robot packaging system) consisting of three different physical models with different levels of detailing, implemented in different software tools is shown. The implemented demonstrator consists of a conveyor belt which is powered by an induction motor and a robot arm which is used for palletizing bags.},
