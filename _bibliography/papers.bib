  abstract = {At its conception mechatronics was viewed purely in terms of the ability to integrate the technologies of mechanical and electrical engineering with computer science to transfer functionality, and hence complexity, from the mechanical domain to the software domain. However, as technologies, and in particular computing technologies, have evolved so the nature of mechatronics has changed from being purely associated with essentially stand-alone systems such as robots to providing the smart objects and systems which are the building blocks for Cyber-Physical Systems, and hence for Internet of Things and Cloud-based systems. With the possible advent of a 4th Industrial Revolution structured around these systems level concepts, mechatronics must again adapt its world view, if not its underlying technologies, to meet this new challenge.},

To gain competitiveness companies have to provide offerings that are adding value for the customer, which can be achieved through a product-service-system (PSS). Therefore, this study aims at developing an integrated approach to develop all components of a PSS while including agile approaches to ensure customer-centricity. After a thorough literature research on the topics of PSS and agile methods was carried out, a reference model was developed which integrates the specificities of these two areas forming an integrated framework for agile PSS design. The result of this research is a reference model which includes crucial steps which are specific for the development of PSS and includes customers in almost all steps. Moreover, the framework orchestrates the development of hardware, software and services specifically for PSS.},

  abstract = {Volatility in the availability of energy resources is a key challenge to master in the transition to sustainable energy sources. Especially with a rising share of renewable energy sources the situation is expected to intensify. To leverage the situation within an industrial context, energy-aware scheduling could be used. However, state-of-the-art simulation techniques use state-based energy determination, which is merely suitable for recurring manufacturing of products. In order to enable energy-aware scheduling within a changeable manufacturing environment, an alternative approach is researched. The approach aims to disaggregate the used manufacturing entities and identify the individual load patterns. Based on the individual load patterns, a simulation and optimization architecture was derived to conduct energy-aware scheduling in future applications. The used methods include the analysis of current methods for scheduling and energy consumption prediction and derivation of the component-based simulation approach based on the state-of-the-art. Depending on the inclusion of environmental dependencies two optimization architectures were created. A case study with a small-scale demonstrator was conducted to present and validate the approach. Within the scope of the small-scale demonstrator the approach could be validated. The main contribution of the publication is the provision of an approach for scheduling orders for merely non-recurring jobs.},

Therefore thermal resistance values of all winding materials are required and have to be measured. A measurement setup for the measurement of thermal resistances was developed, built and tested. In this paper the used measurement principle and the consideration of systematic measurement errors are described. A finite element method (FEM) simulation of the measurement setup is used to verify the calculation of the thermal resistance values.},

Therefore, in this work our focus is on the carbon emissions in the production phase of powertrain components. Data of raw materials used, production processes and supply chains is necessary and the uncertainties associated also have to be considered. At present, there is only little sufficient support for design engineers regarding the collection of relevant data for the carbon footprint calculation of powertrain production. In this work a data structure, which supports the collection of relevant data, including possible data sources, is presented.},

A decision support process is therefore needed to help in the choice of a satisfactory solution. In this paper, we propose an approach to integrate the performance criteria of the three sustainability dimensions in the design process of mechatronic systems. The proposed approach considers all lifecycle phases to prevent the phenomenon of impact transfer. It also uses a decision support method to assist the process of selection and calculation of different indicators for each alternative and the comparative analysis of the different investigated alternatives. The used research methodology starts with a literature review with the definition of specific LCSA methods followed by a prescriptive study establishing the process model and an empirical study on uses cases. The proposed approach is applied in a case study analysing two concepts of milk frother.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, several manufacturing systems are evolving towards a greater collaboration between human and robots. The development of such systems requires integrated design tasks involving many disciplines and domains such as systems engineering, safety analyses and multiphysics. Furthermore, the increasing presence of multiple and structured requirements makes the use of models inevitable during the designing phases and also strongly helpful during other phases of the system life-cycle. Besides, for a better efficiency, there is an increasing demand to have a Digital Twin of the system to be used for different purposes such as design improvements by playing different scenarios, virtual commissioning and controlling maintenance activities. In this paper, we first summarize the research context, the reference methodologies, and the emerging needs for Digital Twin creation. Then, we apply a design approach including Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), Model-Based Safety Assessment (MBSA) and multi-physics modeling for the design of a collaborative workplace for the assembly of Electro-Mechanical Actuators on an aircraft wing. An operational flow to integrate MBSE, MBSA and multi-physics modelling activities is provided. Then, after having identified some relevant scientific barriers, we provide a meta-model for system models integration within a digital twin framework.},

As late changes during the realization and detailed design phases lead to a considerable increase in costs and design time, it is necessary to introduce more flexibility during the development process. The agile approach has already proven successful in the design of software system and offer many benefits, as it aims to limit the rigidity of the specifications, interfaces and organization, and to involve in a more flexible way the different actors, customers, specifiers and partners.

To meet this requirement, it has been proposed the concept of product\textendash service system (PSS) that is not simply an extension of physical products by delivering non-physical services to customers, but a systematic combination of products and services. However, most current studies do not consider the multi-disciplinary integration relating to the PSS design process, during which the collaboration within the product and service design teams should be achieved. Otherwise, the large number of iterative design activities resulting from poor multi-disciplinary collaboration may lead to long development lead-times and high development cost.To achieve the multi-disciplinary integration during the PSS design process, the authors propose an integrated design method using an improved interface modelling approach that provides a structural form to represent the information transfer between product and service components. The proposed PSS design method enables the product and service design teams to decrease the iterative design activities and improve their collaboration so that a more integrated design process can be accomplished. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the design method is applied to a design case of an industrial PSS.},
