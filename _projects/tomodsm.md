## Project context

Global targets such as the Paris Agreement stipulate that global warming must be
limited to a maximum of 2 Â°C by 2050. This requires the "energy turnaround," i.e., a
switch to low-emission, renewable energy sources. However, these renewable
energies are generally only available on an irregular basis. As a result, a change in
the energy distribution and consumption structure is also foreseeable. Accounting
for about one-third of electricity demand, the industrial sector is a major player that
will continue to increase demand for electrical energy by substituting fossil fuels.

The consumer-side adjustment of energy demand in response to energy supply is
also known as demand-side management, which encompasses the goals of energy
efficiency and demand response measures. While the heavy industry has received
considerable attention, there is a lack of research on DSM in less energy-intensive
industries. Considering its electrical energy intensity and a high share of total
consumption, the light industry has great potential to improve the situation with its
dependence on electricity increasing in the future.

## Objective

A framework for demand-side management in manufacturing will be developed to
exploit this potential. Research often addresses demand response and energy
efficiency in isolation, identifying improvements for individual aspects. However,
current research shows an interrelation between the topics of energy efficiency and
energy flexibility. Intelligent energy consumption planning in definable time horizons
from minutes to days or weeks, would synergize with storage solutions such as
hydrogen and support or enable high penetration of renewable energy sources.

## Goals

Expected results include the methodological basis for creating demand-side
management systems in electricity-intensive production environments, including
smart machines and equipment. It is envisaged to create behavioural models of
energy consumers, which can be applied at different levels of detail, enabling
consumption planning for variable time horizons. In the framework to be developed,
the energy flow should also be decomposed as far as possible, and constraints and
dependencies should be mapped. This can be based on an ISO 50000 "Energy
Management" certification, which is often available in the industry.
